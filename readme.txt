New build of the system. Camera was a real pain, with crowsnest v4 having
problems with v1 raspi cameras. Fixed via this note at ratrig:

https://os.ratrig.com/blog/crowsnest-v4-breaking-changes-manual-upgrade/

and adding 

dtoverlay=ov5647

to my config.txt file

-----

install https://github.com/JeremyRuhland/klipper_network_status.git

and add back to menu structure
